            <a style="font-size: 25px;">During my years of study, I was able to acquire experience in IT,<br> and even
                more thanks to the work-study program with a company that has accompanied me throughout the years, to
                train me and give me work to do.<br><br> With the courses my knowledge is developed in different
                computer fields. Like website creation, with HTML and CSS, I was also able to learn JavaScript and
                GoogleScript, use computer tools.</a><br><br>
            <a style="font-size: 25px;">At this date, I am studying on a work-study program at the CFA Utec in
                émerainville.<br> Where I am training in mobile development, with Arduino, C</a>
